Vault Wars is a fan-made Star Warsâ„¢â€“inspired custom theme for Obsidian.  
Light mode channels the Jedi Order with blue and green accents, while Dark mode embraces the Sith with crimson highlights.  
Headings glow like lightsabers, horizontal rules shimmer like energy blades, and glowing borders tie the look together.
